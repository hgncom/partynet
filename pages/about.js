        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

Our mission is to provide you with the inspiration, guidance, and practical advice you need to create meaningful celebrations, regardless of your budget, experience level, or occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're committed to making party planning accessible, enjoyable, and stress-free, so you can focus on what really matters: connecting with the people you care about and creating joyful experiences.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>

          <div className={styles.storyText}>
            <p>
              Party.net began in 2025 with a simple observation: planning celebrations should be as enjoyable as the events themselves. After years of organizing everything from intimate dinner parties to large-scale corporate events, our founder recognized that many people find party planning overwhelming rather than exciting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drawing on extensive experience in event planning, hospitality, and digital content creation, we assembled a team of celebration experts passionate about sharing their knowledge. Together, we've created a resource hub that combines practical planning tools with creative inspiration to help you become a confident host.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a small blog has grown into a comprehensive celebration resource, but our core values remain the same: accessibility, creativity, and a genuine desire to help people connect through memorable gatherings.
