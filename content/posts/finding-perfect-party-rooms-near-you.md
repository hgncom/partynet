## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it typically cost to rent a party room?

Costs vary widely based on location, venue type, day of week, and season. Community centers might charge as little as $50-$100 per hour, while hotel ballrooms can cost $1,000-$5,000+ for an event. Restaurant private rooms often require food and beverage minimums rather than rental fees.

### Can I bring my own food to a rented party room?

This depends entirely on the venue's policies. Some locations, particularly community centers and outdoor pavilions, allow outside food. Restaurants and hotels typically require you to use their catering services. Always ask about outside food policies before booking.

### What's the difference between a venue rental fee and a food & beverage minimum?

A rental fee is a flat charge for using the space. A food & beverage minimum is the amount you must spend on the venue's food and drinks, but doesn't include additional costs like service fees or gratuity. Some venues charge both, while others may waive the rental fee if you meet a certain F&B minimum.

### How can I find last-minute party rooms?

For last-minute bookings, try:
- Calling venues directly and asking about cancellations
- Using venue marketplace apps with "available now" filters
- Considering non-traditional times (weekday mornings/afternoons)
- Looking at restaurants with private dining rooms
- Checking with hotel event coordinators about unused meeting spaces
