## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do we honor loved ones who have passed away?

Consider a memorial table with photos, mention them in your program, incorporate their favorite flowers, play their favorite songs, or wear/carry an heirloom item that belonged to them. Keep these tributes tasteful and meaningful rather than somber.

### What's the best way to handle children at our wedding?

You have several options: welcome children with kid-friendly activities and menu options, specify an adults-only celebration on invitations, or arrange on-site childcare during the reception. Whatever you choose, be consistent with all guests and communicate clearly.

### How can we make our wedding more sustainable?

Consider digital invitations, locally-sourced flowers and food, reusable or compostable serviceware, donation of leftovers, and decor that can be repurposed or donated. Many vendors now offer eco-friendly options—just ask!

### What are some alternatives to traditional wedding registries?

Consider honeymoon funds, charity donations, experience gifts, cash funds for specific goals (home down payment, education), or subscription services. Many online registry platforms now allow you to combine traditional items with these alternative options.
