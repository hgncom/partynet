## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do we honor loved ones who have passed away?
Consider a memorial table with photos, mention them in your program, include a moment of silence, or incorporate their favorite flowers or music into your celebration.

### What's the best way to handle gift registries?
Include registry information on your wedding website, not on formal invitations. Consider offering a range of price points and including charity registries as an option.

Address invitations specifically to invited guests, use your wedding website to clarify, and consider offering childcare options for parents.
