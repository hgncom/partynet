## No-Prep Games (Just People)

These games require nothing but the people at your party, making them perfect for spontaneous entertainment or when you want to avoid extensive setup.

### 1. Two Truths and a Lie: Extended Edition

**Players:** 8-30+
**Time:** 15-30 minutes

**How to Play:** Each person shares three statements about themselves—two true and one false. After everyone guesses which statement is the lie, the person reveals the truth and shares a brief story about one of the true statements. This extended version creates deeper connections in large groups.

**Large Group Tip:** For very large groups, split into circles of 8-10 people, then have each circle send their "champion liar" to a final round.

### 2. The Human Bingo Challenge

**Players:** 15-50+
**Time:** 20-30 minutes

**How to Play:** Create bingo cards with interesting characteristics or experiences in each square ("Has visited more than 5 countries," "Can speak multiple languages," "Has met a celebrity"). Guests mingle and find people who match each square, collecting signatures. First to complete a row or the entire card wins.

**Why It Works:** Forces mingling across the entire group rather than staying in comfortable cliques.

### 3. Wavelength

**Players:** 10-30+ (in teams)
**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**How to Play:** Divide into teams. One team member sees a spectrum card with two extremes (like "Hot-Cold" or "Ethical-Unethical") and a target position on that spectrum. They give a clue to help teammates guess where the target falls. Points awarded based on how close the guess is.

**No Supplies Version:** Create your own spectrums and use hand positions to indicate guesses.

### 4. Paranoia

**Players:** 10-30+
**Time:** 20-40 minutes

**How to Play:** Players sit in a circle. One person whispers a question to the person on their left, who must answer out loud with someone's name in the room. Only the question-asker and answerer know the question. The named person can choose to know the question by flipping a coin—heads they find out, tails they remain paranoid.

**Party Tip:** Keep questions light and fun rather than potentially hurtful.

### 5. The Resistance/Avalon

**Players:** 5-10 per game (can run multiple games for larger groups)
**Time:** 30 minutes

**How to Play:** A social deduction game where some players are secretly saboteurs trying to undermine the group's missions. Through discussion, voting, and careful observation, players try to identify who's who.

**DIY Version:** Use playing cards to assign roles if you don't have the official game.

---

## Card Games for Parties

Card games offer structured fun with minimal setup—perfect for large groups that want engaging entertainment without elaborate preparations.

### 6. Cards Against Humanity (or Apples to Apples)

**Players:** 4-20+ (can split into multiple games)
**Time:** 30-60 minutes

**How to Play:** Each round, one player reads a question or fill-in-the-blank statement. Other players submit answer cards they think the reader will find funniest or most appropriate. The reader chooses their favorite response.

**Large Group Hack:** For very large groups, play in teams of two, with partners collaborating on which cards to play.

### 7. Blank Slate

**Players:** 3-8 per game (run multiple games for larger groups)
**Time:** 20-30 minutes

**How to Play:** Players write a word that pairs with a prompt word (like "BIRTHDAY ____"). Points are awarded for matching answers with exactly one other player—encouraging thinking alike, but not too alike.

**DIY Version:** Use index cards and create your own prompt words.

### 8. Codenames

**Players:** 4-16+ (in two teams)
**Time:** 15-30 minutes

**How to Play:** Two teams compete to identify their agents from a grid of word cards using one-word clues. Each team has a spymaster who knows which words belong to their team and gives clues to help teammates find them while avoiding the assassin card.

**XXL Version:** For groups of 20+, use two sets combined and have multiple guessers on each team.

### 9. Anomia

**Players:** 3-8 per game (run multiple games)
**Time:** 20-30 minutes

**How to Play:** Players flip cards showing symbols and categories. When two players' symbols match, they race to name something from each other's categories. Fast thinking and quick reactions make this hilarious.

**Tournament Style:** For large groups, run multiple games and have the winners compete in a championship round.

### 10. The Mind

**Players:** 2-4 per game (multiple games for larger groups)
**Time:** 15 minutes

**How to Play:** A cooperative game where players must play numbered cards in ascending order without communicating. The challenge? Developing a group "mind" to sense when it's your turn to play.

**Large Group Adaptation:** Create a tournament bracket or play in teams with each team trying to achieve the highest level.

---

## Drinking Games for Adults

For adult gatherings where alcohol is being served, these games add structure and fun to the drinking experience. Always encourage responsible consumption and provide non-alcoholic options.

### 11. Never Have I Ever: Deluxe Edition

**Players:** 10-30+
**Time:** 20-40 minutes

**How to Play:** Players hold up five fingers. Going around the circle, each person states something they've never done. Anyone who has done it puts a finger down and takes a sip. First to put all fingers down "wins."

**Deluxe Rules:** Use category cards to keep the game fresh and prevent it from getting too personal too quickly.

### 12. Flip Cup Tournament

**Players:** 8-40+ (in teams)
**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**How to Play:** Two teams line up on opposite sides of a table. Players take turns drinking from their cup, then placing it on the edge of the table and flipping it upside down with a finger flick. Once successful, the next teammate goes. First team to finish wins.

**Large Group Format:** Create a tournament bracket with multiple teams competing for the championship.

### 13. Kings Cup

**Players:** 4-20
**Time:** 30-60 minutes

**How to Play:** Arrange cards in a circle around an empty cup. Players take turns drawing cards, with each card corresponding to a rule (e.g., 7 = Heaven, everyone points up, last person drinks). Kings mean pouring some drink into the center cup, and the person who draws the fourth King drinks it.

**Large Group Adaptation:** For very large groups, play at multiple tables with the winners advancing to a "champions table."

### 14. Beer Pong Tournament

**Players:** 4-40+ (in teams of 2)
**Time:** 1-2 hours

**How to Play:** Teams take turns throwing ping pong balls into the opposing team's cups. When a ball lands in a cup, that cup is removed and its contents consumed. First team to eliminate all opposing cups wins.

**Tournament Structure:** For large parties, create a proper tournament bracket and award a small prize to the winning team.

### 15. Ride the Bus

**Players:** 5-15 per game (multiple games for larger groups)
**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**How to Play:** A multi-stage card game where players must guess card characteristics (color, higher/lower, inside/outside, suit). Wrong guesses result in drinking. The final stage—"riding the bus"—involves a pyramid of cards with increasingly severe drinking penalties.

**Party Tip:** Use a whiteboard to track the "bus riders" across multiple games for added entertainment.

## Video Game Party Options

Digital games can entertain large groups with minimal setup and maximum engagement, even for non-gamers.

### 19. Among Us (Local Network)

**Players:** 4-15 per game
**Time:** 20-30 minutes per round

**How to Play:** Players work as crewmates completing tasks on a spaceship, but some are impostors trying to eliminate everyone. Through discussion and voting, the group tries to identify the impostors.

**IRL Enhancement:** Play in the same room for added tension as you try to read each other's real-life reactions.

### 20. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

**Players:** 2-6 active players, rotating teams

### 24. Trivia Tournament

**Players:** 10-50+ (in teams)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I choose the right games for my specific group?

Consider your guests' personalities, physical abilities, and comfort with different types of interaction. For groups that don't know each other well, start with icebreaker-style games before moving to more complex or personal options. For close friends, you can begin with more competitive or revealing games.

### What if some guests don't want to participate in certain games?

Always make participation optional and have alternative activities available. Create a comfortable "spectator" area where non-participants can watch and potentially join later. Never pressure anyone into drinking games or activities that make them uncomfortable.

### How many games should I plan for a 3-4 hour party?

Prepare 4-6 different games, but be flexible with timing. Some games might be hits that guests want to play multiple rounds of, while others might not resonate with your particular group. Having a variety allows you to read the room and adjust accordingly.

### What's the best way to explain game rules to a large group?

For complex games, consider creating simple one-page instruction sheets or sending rules in advance. For in-the-moment explanations, demonstrate a quick practice round rather than explaining every detail. Most importantly, assure everyone that they'll pick it up as they go—perfection isn't required for fun!
