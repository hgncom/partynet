## Frequently Asked Questions

### How far in advance should I buy party supplies?

Purchase non-perishable supplies 3-4 weeks before your event to avoid last-minute stress and stock issues. For themed parties during popular seasons (Halloween, graduation), shop even earlier as supplies may sell out. Perishable items like fresh flowers or balloons should be purchased 1-2 days before the event.

### How many supplies do I need per guest?

For tableware, plan for 1.5-2 plates per person, 3-4 napkins per person, and 2-3 cups per person. Having extra prevents running out if items are dropped or if unexpected guests arrive. For food and beverages, calculate approximately 1.5 servings per person for main dishes and 2-3 servings per person for snacks and appetizers.

### What's worth splurging on vs. saving on?

Invest in items that significantly impact guest experience or photos: good quality food and beverages, comfortable seating, and statement decorations (like a backdrop or centerpieces). Save on single-use items that won't be remembered: basic napkins, standard balloons, and generic party favors.

### How can I create a cohesive look without buying a pre-made party pack?

Choose 2-3 colors that complement your theme and use them consistently across all elements. Focus on varying textures and materials rather than introducing more colors. Use neutral serving pieces that won't clash with your color scheme. Create one or two statement decorations that clearly convey your theme, then use simpler coordinating items elsewhere.
